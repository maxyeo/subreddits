&gt; **gadget** *(noun)* - a small mechanical / electrical device or tool, especially an ingenious or novel one.

### Need gadget advice?

## [Gadget Advice Superthread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/about/sticky?num=1)


 
### Domain white list
 
## \/r/gadgets works with a [domain white list](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/wiki/domainlist), any domain not on the list will need to be approved before the submission will be visible. 



### Please read the rules:

1. Submissions must be about a gadget. (Software alone is not a gadget. Gadget concepts which do not actually exist belong in /r/ImaginaryGadgets).

2. Self promotion is not allowed in /r/gadgets. Do not submit links to sites that you are affiliated with.

3. Submissions about pre-release or pre-order products are subject to these rules/conditions: 
   - These submissions are allowed if they are offered by a company with an already-established market presence. 
   - Submissions about products that are rumors will be removed. 
   - Submissions about products in the crowdfunding stage are never allowed, regardless of developer.

4. No direct image or video links. If you wish to submit an image or video, do so in a selfpost and include a conversation starter.

5. Describe the gadget in your post title. No sensationalized, misleading or non-descriptive titles.

6. Articles must about a single gadget, listicles are not allowed.

7. Keep discussions civil and respectful. Know your [reddiquette!](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette). Comments should be on-topic and contribute to the conversation.

8. No Adult Material.

9. English only.

10. If you need advice about a gadget you should do so in the advice [superthread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/about/sticky). However we highly recommend you also look [at the list of related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/wiki/related_subreddits) since you are more likely to find an answer in a specialized subreddit. 

11. Support original sources. Avoid blogs/websites that rehost content without giving credit. Exact copies are never allowed, as are copies that are just slightly rewritten versions of original articles. 

12. Follow the [reddit site-wide rules](http://reddit.com/rules).

### Moderation Policy

## We use the [reddit FAQ guidelines for spam](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatconstitutesspam) when removing spam posts. Additionally, we use a [whitelist system](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/wiki/domainlist).

## **If your submission does not appear in the new tab** - it may have been caught by the spam filter. [Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgadgets), and we will look at it.

***A note on reporting posts:*** If the post you're reporting isn't obviously spam or off-topic let us know the reason by modmail or we'll simply reapprove the post.

{"display_name":"comics","description":"##About \/r/comics

&gt; This subreddit is for everything related to print comics (comic books, graphic novels, and strips) and webcomics.  Artists are encouraged to post their own work.  News and media for adaptations based on comic books are welcome.    

&gt; **If You Are A Comic Artist**    

&gt; * Comic artists are welcome to post their own work any way they want.   
* If you don't want to link to your website, put [OC] in your post title (it means "Original Content") or [request Artist Flair](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcomics).  (Info on flair is below.)   

&gt; **If You Are Not An Artist**  
  
&gt; * Link to an original source like the artist's website or a syndication site.  
* Link to the page, not the image file, so the artist gets the credit and site traffic.         
* Imgur/rehost links are ok for translations, but you must also state clearly it is a translation and link to the non-English source in a comment.  

##General Conduct

&gt; * Don't complain about the unfunniness of a post or attack artists posting their content
* Don't make drama for drama's sake.  No trolling.
* Tag NSFW content when needed.  Links to sites that are NSFW should be tagged.
* Don't put the punchline in the post title
* Don't change the watermark on a comic you didn't make 
* Avoid URL shortening/hijacking tools (wp.me, bit.ly, su.pr, etc.)
* Abuse of the [OC] System will result in a ban!

##How to find Original Sources

&gt; * [Google Search by Image](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/images/searchbyimage.html)
* [Tineye Reverse Image Search](http://www.tineye.com/)
* [OhNoRobot Webcomic Search](http://www.ohnorobot.com/)

##How to get Artist Flair

&gt; Do you draw a comic? [Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23comics) with some proof and the name of your strip for some username flair.  The easiest way to provide proof is to post something on your comic's website that references your Reddit account.  If your request has no response after 48 hours, reply to it to bump it for more attention.

&gt; &amp;nbsp;
    
&gt; [ ](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23comics "flair-talk")

&gt; * Rage comics (post in [/r/f7u12](/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu) or /r/ragecomics)

#[Posting Rules](/r/pics/about/rules)#


1. **No screenshots.  No pictures with added/superimposed text.** *This includes [image macros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_macro), comics, maps, infographics, and most diagrams. Text (e.g. a URL) serving to credit the original author is exempt.*

1. **No porn or gore.** *NSFW content must be tagged.*

1. **No personal information.** *This includes anything hosted on Facebook's servers, as they can be traced to the original account holder. Stalking &amp; harassment will not be tolerated.* ***No missing-persons requests!***

1. **No post titles soliciting votes** *(e.g. "upvote this").*

1. **No DAE, "[FIXED]", "cake day", or "photoshop this" posts, nor posts addressed to a specific redditor.** *"[FIXED]" posts should be added as a comment to the original image. Photoshop requests should be directed to /r/PhotoshopRequest.*

1. **Submissions must link directly to a specific image file or to a website with minimal ads.** *We do not allow blog hosting of images ("blogspam"), but links to albums on image hosting websites are okay. URL shorteners are prohibited. URLs in image or album descriptions are prohibited.* 

1. **No animated images.** *Please submit them to /r/gif, /r/gifs, or /r/reactiongifs instead.*

1. **Three strikes, you're out for misleading posts.** If three of your posts are tagged misleading by moderators, you will be banned.

* Please be civil when commenting. Racist/sexist/homophobic comments and personal attacks against other redditors do not belong here.

* If your submission appears to be filtered, but **definitely** meets the above rules, [please send us a message](/message/compose?to=%23pics) with a link to the **comments section** of your post (not a direct link to the image). **Don't delete it**  as that just makes the filter hate you! 

* If you come across any rule violations please report the submission or  [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23pics) and one of us will remove it!

* Serial reposters may be filtered. False claims of ownership will result in a ban.

* Please try to come up with **original post titles**. Submissions that use certain clichés/memes will be automatically tagged with a warning.

* **Professional photographer or artist?** Read [these guidelines](/r/pics/wiki/professionals) for linking to your own site and obtaining 'Verified' user flair.

&gt;* Info
* [**Rules**](/r/torrents/wiki/rules)

#Welcome!#

Welcome to the torrents subreddit.  We are a thriving community dedicated to helping users old and new understand and use torrents.  Please read over the rules before contributing.  We only have a few, but they are important.
  
#Rules#

1. **No pirated content.** ^\[[why?](/comments/13gmua/_/c73uvb9) ^[because.](/comments/1fo5zl)] This subreddit is for the discussion of torrenting culture and learning how to use torrents. Topics focused on piracy &amp; pirating specific content will be removed. Try /r/Piracy or /r/PiratedGames instead.

2. **Search before you post!**

3. **No invite requests/offers.** For invites try /r/Invites. For trackers with open signup try /r/OpenSignups or [/r/Tracker's open signup thread] (https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/3vn9jw/open_signups_thread/?sort=new). For info on recruitment/joining private trackers see /r/Trackers.

4. We are not a **VPN or Proxy support forum**, use /r/VPNTorrents or /r/VPN.

5. This is not a place to discuss **DDL sites**. Try /r/filesharing instead.

6. YIFY encodes are [terrible](/r/torrents/comments/1bo3vs/im_seeing_a_few_people_complaining_about_yify/c98f6dy) and [should never be viewed](http://i.imgur.com/DXB9akl.jpg) so stop posting about them.

7. Peerblock &amp; related blocklists have [never done anything](http://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/17gold) despite what your confirmation bias has proven.

8. This is not a [TorrentFreak RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Torrentfreak) so please don't post every article they write.

9. Do not request or post **torrent links**. For legal torrents try /r/torrentlinks. For illegal torrents try ~~/r/illegaltorrents~~, ~~/r/illegaltorrentlinks~~, /r/illegaltorrents2, /r/toteslegaltorrents, /r/deletedtorrents, /r/BestTorrents, /r/torrentrequests, /r/pirating.

10. The [new](http://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/new) queue is why half the mods drink and the other half cry themselves to sleep."}
