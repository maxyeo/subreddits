# subreddits

*output datasets*
- display_names.txt - a list of subreddit names from reddituserpostingbehavior.csv (rather quick to create from `parse_words/subreddits_to_file`)
- descriptions.txt - json formatted subreddits only in display_names.txt with their descriptions as found from subreddits.txt (rather long to create from `parse_words/descriptions_to_file` about 30 minutes)
